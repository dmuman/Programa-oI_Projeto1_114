It was a project for the first semester at the uni.
Using Python - we had to make a program that would make appointments for doctors, depending on their availability, mothers' conditions etc. 
Made in collaboration with my dear friend and colleague: https://github.com/eggyvinx
The project is fully functioning. (except for one test)

To start the program from cmd: **python3 refresh.py inputFile1 inputFile2 inputFile3**
Where:
- **inputFile1** is a file with doctors.
- **inputFile2** is a file with schedules.
- **inputFile3** is a file with requests (mothers).

Test files are in the testFiles folder
